Features ✨

Text-to-Image Generation: Generate high-resolution images from textual descriptions.
Multi-Language Support: Works with both English and Persian text.
Advanced Architectures: Combines VAE, GAN, and Diffusion Models for superior image quality.
CLIP Integration: Leverages OpenAI's CLIP for better text-to-image alignment.
Customizable: Easily adapt the model for different resolutions and datasets.
Installation 🛠️

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
PyTorch 2.0+
CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)
Steps

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/kinhofcod4242/MITRA.git
cd MITRA
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage 🚀

Training the Model

To train MITRA on your dataset, run:

bash
Copy
python main.py --data_dir path/to/dataset --epochs 100 --batch_size 4 --resolution 256
Generating Images

To generate an image from a text prompt, use:

bash
Copy
python generate.py --text "A beautiful mountain landscape" --output_path output.png
Architecture 🏗️

MITRA combines several advanced AI techniques:

VAE (Variational Autoencoder):
Compresses images into a latent space.
Enables efficient image reconstruction.
GAN (Generative Adversarial Network):
Generates high-quality images.
Uses a U-Net architecture with Attention Mechanisms.
Diffusion Models:
Adds and removes noise to refine image generation.
Ensures smooth and realistic outputs.
CLIP Integration:
Converts text into semantic embeddings.
Aligns generated images with textual descriptions.
Dataset 📂

MITRA can be trained on any image-text dataset. Some popular options include:

COCO: Common Objects in Context.
Flickr30k: 30,000 images with captions.
Custom Datasets: Use your own image-text pairs.
Place your dataset in the data/ directory and update the data_dir argument in the training script.

Training 🏋️

Key Parameters

--data_dir: Path to the dataset.
--epochs: Number of training epochs.
--batch_size: Batch size for training.
--resolution: Output image resolution (e.g., 256, 512).

Inference 🖼️

Generating Images

To generate an image from a text prompt:

bash
Copy
python generate.py --text "A futuristic city at night" --output_path city.png
Example Outputs

Text Prompt	Generated Image
"A cat sitting in a forest"	Cat
"A beautiful sunset over the ocean"	Sunset
